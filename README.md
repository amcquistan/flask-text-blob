# flask-text-blob-sentiment-analyzer

A minimal [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) application that uses [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/), [BeautifySoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) and, [Requests](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/) to do text analytics on blog posts to determine sentiment polarity and subjectivity. The detailed explanation of how the code works can be found on in the following blog post featured on [The Coding Interface](https://thecodinginterface.com/blog/text-analytics-app-with-flask-and-textblob/)
